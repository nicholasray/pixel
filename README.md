# Pixel

![Visual regression HTML reporter showing failing and passing tests](reporter.png)

ðŸš¨ **Pixel is a work in progress and experimental. Only use it when you're feeling dangerous. ðŸš¨

Pixel is a visual regression tool for MediaWiki developers/QA engineers that
helps you replace manual testing with automated tests that catch web ui
regressions before users see them. It *currently* integrates
[BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS),
[MediaWiki-Docker](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Docker), and Docker
under the hood.

Check out the hourly reports Pixel has generated at https://pixel.wmcloud.org
which compare the latest release branch against master, and read
[T302246](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T302246) for the motivation behind
the tool.

## Quick Start

First, clone the repo wherever you wish and `cd` into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/wikimedia/pixel.git && cd pixel
```

Pixel runs in multiple Docker containers to eliminate inconsistent rendering
issues across environments. Please install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and 
**make sure it is running** prior to using Pixel.

Finally, install the CLI dependency:

```sh
npm install
```

Running Pixel for the first time can take a long time (e.g. 5 minutes) as it downloads Docker images, 
clones MediaWiki core (> 2GB) and a number of extensions/skins. It will be much faster on subsequent 
runs as this data has already been downloaded.

## Usage

Your workflow will usually involve the following ordered steps:

### 1) Take reference (baseline) screenshots with `master` or release branch code

If you want to checkout the latest code in `master` or `main` from MediaWiki
core and all of its installed extensions and skins and then take reference
screenshots that your test screenshots (step 2) will be compared against, then:

```sh
./pixel.js reference

```

Or if you want the reference to be the latest release branch:

```sh
./pixel.js reference -b latest-release
```

Or if you want the reference to be a certain release branch:

```sh
./pixel.js reference -b origin/wmf/1.37.0-wmf.19
```

If you want to run the mobile visual regression test suite pass the `--group mobile` flag.

### 2) Take test screenshots with changed code

If you want to pull a change or multiple changes down from gerrit, take screenshots with these changes on top of master and then compare these screenshots against the reference screenshots, then

```sh
./pixel.js test -c Iff231a976c473217b0fa4da1aa9a8d1c2a1a19f2
```

Note that although change id `Iff231a976c473217b0fa4da1aa9a8d1c2a1a19f2` has a
`Depends-On` dependency, it is the only change that needs to be passed. Pixel
will figure out and pull down the rest of the dependencies provided that it has
the relevant repositories (set in repositories.json).

An HTML report of your test results with screenshots will be opened
automatically on a Mac after the test completes. If you're not on a Mac, you can
manually open the file at `report/index.html`.

Additionally, Pixel runs a server at `http://localhost:3000` (default) which can
be used to interact with/debug the same server that the tests use.

If you want to run the mobile visual regression test suite pass the `--group mobile` flag.

### Stopping the services

If you want to stop all of Pixel's services, run:

```sh
./pixel.js stop
```

### Updates

Updating Pixel to the latest version is more of a hassle than it should be. It
requires:

```sh
./pixel.js update
```

This command will pull the latest code and destroy all Docker images,
containers, and volumes associated with Pixel to ensure that it is using the
latest database seed data and that the necessary Docker images are rebuilt with
the latest code. As a result, updates can take awhile.

### Cleanup

Sometimes after making MediaWiki code changes, database changes, or having
issues with the containers you just want to throw away everything and start
Pixel with a clean slate. To do that, run:

```sh
./pixels.js clean
```

You can also reset Pixel's database to its original state with:

```sh
./pixel.js reset-db
```

## Development

### Changing or adding tests

All tests are located in config files in the root directory (e.g.
configDesktop.js) and follow BackstopJS conventions. For more info on how to
change or add tests, please refer to the
[BackstopJS](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS) README.

Scenarios for mobile site are defined in configMobile.js.

### Configuring MediaWiki

All mediawiki config is in [LocalSettings.php](LocalSettings.php) and can be
changed. For example, maybe you are working on a new feature in the `Vector`
skin that is feature flagged and want to enable it. All changes made in this
file will be automatically reflected in the Docker services without having to
restart them.

### Installed extensions and skins

Pixel ships with a number of MediaWiki extensions and skins already installed.
Please reference the [repositories.json](repositories.json) file to see a
list of these.

## Known Issues

* Pixel has only been tested on machines running on `x86` chips. It does not currently work with `arm64` (e.g. MacBooks with M1 or M2 chips). Please follow https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS/issues/1300
